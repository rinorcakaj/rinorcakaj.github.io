I build efficient computer vision models and scalable ML data systems for deployment in real-world products.

I’m a Data Scientist at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai/) (autonomous driving) and Co-Founder & Full-Stack Developer at [Fletza](https://www.fletza.com/). Previously, I completed a PhD in Deep Learning at the University of Stuttgart, in cooperation with Robert Bosch GmbH, advised by [Prof. Dr.-Eng. Bin Yang](https://www.iss.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Yang-00004/) and co-supervised by [Dr. rer. nat. Jens Mehnert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjensmehnert/).

My main research contribution is Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) for CNNs (ACCV 2024), achieving up to 25% CPU / 15% GPU inference speed-ups while maintaining accuracy across ImageNet, Cityscapes, and Pascal VOC.

For collaborations, technical discussions, or talks and workshops, reach out via [email](mailto:cakajrinor@gmail.com). My CV is available [here](/cv/).

## Highlights
- **Efficient CNN inference:** MoD for CNNs (ACCV 2024), up to **25% CPU / 15% GPU** speed-ups while maintaining accuracy
- **Publications & IP:** 5 publications and 5 patent applications (1 published)
- **Applied ML:** Wayve (autonomous driving), Bosch (industrial PhD), Quality Match (data quality)
- **Talks & workshops:** AI/LLM fundamentals, prompt engineering, and responsible AI for workplace settings (200+ participants)

## Current work

### Wayve - Data Scientist
- ML for autonomous driving with a focus on dataset quality and scalable data curation
- Developing evaluation workflows and quality signals to support training and validation at scale

### Fletza - Co-Founder & Full-Stack Developer
- Platform that transforms lecture materials (PDF, Word, PPTX) into flashcards, quizzes, and exam questions
- SM-2 spaced repetition and exam simulations with automatic feedback
- Learn more at [www.fletza.com](https://www.fletza.com)

## Selected publication
- [Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) for CNNs](/publication/2024-10-01-mod) - ACCV 2024 ([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17016))  
  **Authors**: Rinor Cakaj, Jens Mehnert, Bin Yang  
  **Contribution**: Channel-selective inference for CNNs to reduce compute while preserving accuracy.  
  **Selected results**:
  - ImageNet: ResNet75-MoD matches ResNet50 with 25% CPU / 15% GPU speed-up; ResNet86-MoD +0.45% accuracy with 6% CPU / 5% GPU speed-up
  - Cityscapes: FCN-ResNet86-MoD +0.95% mIoU at similar cost
  - Pascal VOC: Faster-RCNN-ResNet86-MoD +0.37% mAP (+0.4% AP50) with 10% CPU speed-up
